I don't really know who's even going to end up at this site since I created it mainly to relearn scripting over winter break but I'll be working to clean up the site and to rewrite much of it. I used [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as it provided an easy way to build a static site and I wrote my own photo gallery (check out the portfolio section) because I didn't like any of the free scripts avaliable. It's really primitive at the moment but I'll be making changes in the future.

My future plans for the site

1. Write awesome posts
2. Make $$$
3. Buy lots of clementines

But in all seriousness [clementines](http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/best-benefits-of-clementine/) prevent free radical damage, help the digestive system, give you better skin and they taste great! Anyways, I'm looking forward to writing more whether it be on tech subjects or interesting findings and if you have any suggestions or thoughts, please comment below!
