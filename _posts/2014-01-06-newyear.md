It's been a nearly week since 2014 but I've decided to start my new year's resolutions. Anyways, this year I plan to do accomplish the following.

1. Not get two D's in school so I can graduate on time
2. Not finish 1lb bags of chips and beef jerky the day I open them
2. Stop losing money from bets (My one friend collects $300 should I play Dota)
3. Actually start using my desk for work instead of my bed

On a more serious note, my resolution this year is to spend a nonzero amount of effort towards each goal. I'm pretty good at losing sight of objectives and it seems every couple months I forget I'm supposed to go to the gym.
