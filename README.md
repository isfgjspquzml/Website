Website
=======

tianyu-shi.com

Pretty much just relearning Javascript, HTML/CSS. What I have up is an uploaded draft with parts I plan to refactor. Also, apologies for vague and undescriptive commit messages.

This website was built using Jekyll.

- 7/2/15, I haven't updated this website for a long time and this was my first experience coding a website from scratch. I'll likely redo this when I have the time but it won't be anytime soon. Thanks for taking a look.
