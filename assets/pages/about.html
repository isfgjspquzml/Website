				<li>I eat clementines by the box and regularly overdose on vitamin C</li>
				<li>I can't lick my right elbow but I can lick my left one</li>
				<li>I don't understand how people can snap their fingers</li>
				<li>I'm the slowest writer I know and I can't write 3 sentences without erasing two</li>

			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silliness aside, my name is Tianyu (sounds like "tien-you") and I'm currently a senior at Duke University. I believe life is about taking chances, making memorable experiences, meeting new people, and eating good food. I'm an individual whose goal is to avoid complacency and keep an open mind. I aim to make my own impact and imprint.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At present (and until robots take over the world), I plan on going into software development. I believe computer science itself is almost magical. It's a craft that allows you to change the world while being interesting and complex with infinite possibilities. Right now I'm still learning, attending hackathons, and starting independent projects. <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Programming aside, my hobbies include about drawing, design, and photography. I'm pretty passionate about visual arts and you can  check out a sample of the things I've done in my portfolio section. I've also been involved in my community having served on board of the Duke Asian Students Association as well as the Duke Inter-Greek Council. In my spare time I enjoy working out and playing badminton, listening to EDM, playing a bit of Dota, spending too much time on Reddit, and socializing with friends.
