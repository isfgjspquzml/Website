            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm known to most my friends as "tee-on-you" but I've been called by everything that comes even remotely close (and not so close). I'm currently a senior at Duke University studying computer science and biomedical engineering while still trying to fit in a passion for visual arts. I'm a person who aims to create my own imprint upon the world and since discovering computer science I've come to believe that computer science itself is almost magical. It's a craft that allows you to change the world while being interesting and complex with infinite possibilities. Until human programmers are obsolete or (more likely) until I decide to walk a different path, I plan on being engaged to the field. Right now I'm still learning, attending hackathons, and starting independent projects.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Programming aside, I'm extremely passionate about drawing, design, and photography. I regularly design flyers and promotional materials for organizations and just recently I started exploring motion design with Adobe Aftereffects. I've also been involved in my community having served on board of Duke Asian Students Association as well as the Duke Inter-Greek Council. In my spare time I enjoy working out and playing badminton, listening to EDM, playing a bit of Dota, reading Reddit, and socializing with friends.
